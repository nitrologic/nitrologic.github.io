An independent developer since September 2024 keeps notes.

### First

GitHub Copilot and I have been learning about the Motorola 6800 chip.

In particular, the MC6800 instruction set and the Robotron 2048 video game that used a pair for it's fun and sound generators.

Pasting HTML 6800 opcode tables at the top of our header file provided Copilot with extra training for it's suggestions to be truly useful as we build disassembler and emulator functions in vanilla C++.

A Lightwave 2024 license has been purchased for no particular reason.

### Second

Several weeks later and a lot more knowledgable we pass on the copilot.
